    №7. THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS

  Persistent local storage is one of the areas where native client applications
    have held an advantage over web applications. For native applications, the
    operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and
    retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state.
    These values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or some
    other place according to platform convention. If your native client
    application needs local storage beyond key/value pairs, you can embed your
    own database, invent your own file format, or any number of other solutions.

Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were
invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent
local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially
dealbreaking downsides:
<ul class="list">
<li>
  Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web
  application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
  </li>
  <li>
    Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data
    unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served
    over SSL)
  </li>
  <li>
    Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your
    application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
  </li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    What we really want is
  </p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>
      a lot of storage space
    </li>
    <li>
      on the client
    </li>
    <li>
      that persists beyond a page refresh
    </li>
    <li>
      and isn’t transmitted to the server
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text">
    Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory in
    different ways.

  A BRIEF HISTORY OF LOCAL STORAGE HACKS BEFORE HTML5
</h2>
<p class="text">
  In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer. Or at least, that’s what
  Microsoft wanted the world to think. To that end, as part of the <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#The_first_browser_war">First Great
   Browser Wars </a>
  , Microsoft invented a great many things and included them in
  their browser-to-end-all-browser-wars, Internet Explorer. One of these things
  was called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531078(v=VS.85)
  .aspx">DHTML Behaviors</a>, and one of these behaviors was called <a href=
  "https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531424(VS.85).aspx">userData.</a>
</p>
<p class="text">
userData allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain, in a
hierarchical XML-based structure. (Trusted domains, such as intranet sites, can
store 10 times that amount. And hey, <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bill_Gates#Misattributed">640 KB ought to be enough for anybody</a>.) IE
does not present any form of permissions dialog, and there is no allowance for
increasing the amount of storage available.
</p>
<p class="text">
In 2002, Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 that gained the unfortunate and
misleading name of “Flash cookies.” Within the Flash environment, the feature is
 properly known as <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/161/tn_16194.html">Local Shared Objects</a>. Briefly, it allows Flash objects to
 store up to 100 KB of data per domain. Brad Neuberg developed an early
 prototype of a Flash-to-JavaScript bridge called <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2005/10/amass-ajax-massive-storage-system.html">AMASS</a> (AJAX Massive Storage
 System), but it was limited by some of Flash’s design quirks. By 2006, with the
 advent of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/livedocs/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/flash/external/ExternalInterface.html">ExternalInterface</a> in Flash 8, accessing LSOs from JavaScript became
 an order of magnitude easier and faster. Brad rewrote AMASS and integrated it
 into the popular <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo Toolkit</a> under the moniker <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/api/jsdoc/HEAD/dojox.storage.manager">dojox.storage</a>. Flash gives each
 domain 100 KB of storage “for free.” Beyond that, it prompts the user for each
 order of magnitude increase in data storage (1 Mb, 10 Mb, and so on).
</p>
<p class="text">
In 2007, Google launched <a href="http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/stopping-gears.html">Gears</a>, an open source browser plugin aimed at providing
 additional capabilities in browsers. Gears provided <a href="https://developers.google.com/?csw=1">an API to an embedded SQL
 database</a> based on <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>. By 2010, Google had shifted efforts toward bringing
 all of the Gears capabilities into web standards like HTML5, and eventually
 <a href="http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html">Google Gears was discontinued</a>.
</p>
<p class="text">
In the meantime, Brad Neuberg and others continued to hack away on dojox.storage
 to provide a unified interface to all these different plugins and APIs. By 2009
 dojox.storage could auto-detect (and provide a unified interface on top of)
 Adobe Flash, Gears, Adobe AIR, and an early prototype of HTML5 storage that was
  only implemented in older versions of Firefox.
</p>
<p class="text">
As you survey these solutions, a pattern emerges: all of them are either
specific to a single browser, or reliant on a third-party plugin. Despite heroic
 efforts to paper over the differences (in dojox.storage), they all expose
 radically different interfaces, have different storage limitations, and present
 different user experiences. So this is the problem that HTML5 set out to solve:
  to provide a standardized API, implemented natively and consistently in
  multiple browsers, without having to rely on third-party plugins.
</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Essays1743; text-align: center;margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-size: 32px">Introducing HTML5 Storage</h2>

<p class="text">What I will refer to as &ldquo;<abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage&rdquo; is a specification named <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/">Web Storage</a>, which was at one time part of the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as &ldquo;Local Storage&rdquo; or &ldquo;<abbr>DOM</abbr> Storage.&rdquo; The naming situation is made even more complicated by some related, similarly-named, emerging standards that I&rsquo;ll discuss later in this chapter.

<p class="text">So what is <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage? Simply put, it&rsquo;s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike <a href="#history">all previous attempts</a> at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

<p class="text">Which browsers? Well, the latest version of pretty much every browser supports <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage&hellip; even Internet Explorer!

<p class="text">From your JavaScript code, you&rsquo;ll access <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage through the <code>localStorage</code> object on the global <code>window</code> object. Before you can use it, you should <a href="detect.html#storage">detect whether the browser supports it</a>.

<p class="text" style="padding-left:6em"><span class="arrow anticlockwiseTopSemicircleArrow"></span> check for <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage
<pre><code style="font-size: 14px">function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p class="text">Instead of writing this function yourself, you can use <a href="detect.html#modernizr">Modernizr</a> to detect support for <abbr>HTML5</abbr> Storage.

<pre><code style="font-size: 14px">if (<mark>Modernizr.localstorage</mark>) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}</code></pre>

<h2 style="font-family: Essays1743; text-align: center;margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%; font-size: 32px">
  USING HTML5 STORAGE
</h2>
<p class="text">
  HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a
  named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is
   a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings
   ,Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a
   string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you
   will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your
   retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.
</p>

<pre><code style="font-size: 14px">interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};</code></pre>

<p class="text">Calling <code>setItem()</code> with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. Calling <code>getItem()</code> with a non-existent key will return <code>null</code> rather than throw an exception.

<p class="text">Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the <code>localStorage</code> object as an associative array. Instead of using the <code>getItem()</code> and <code>setItem()</code> methods, you can simply use square brackets. For example, this snippet of code:

<pre><code style="font-size: 14px">var foo = localStorage.<mark>getItem</mark>("bar");
// ...
localStorage.<mark>setItem</mark>("bar", foo);</code></pre>

<p class="text"; style="font-family; ">&hellip;could be rewritten to use square bracket syntax instead:

<pre><code style="font-size: 14px">var foo = localStorage<mark>["bar"]</mark>;
// ...
localStorage<mark>["bar"]</mark> = foo;</code></pre>
